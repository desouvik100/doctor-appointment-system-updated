# Theme Toggle - Quick User Guide 🌓

## How to Switch Between Light and Dark Mode

### Method 1: Floating Button (Easiest)
Look for the **circular button** in the **bottom-right corner** of your screen:
- 🌙 **Moon icon** = Currently in Light Mode (click to switch to Dark)
- ☀️ **Sun icon** = Currently in Dark Mode (click to switch to Light)

**This button is always visible on every page!**

### Method 2: Navbar Button
Find the theme toggle in the navigation bar at the top:
- **Landing Page**: Next to "Get Started" button
- **Login/Auth Page**: Next to "Back to Home" button  
- **Dashboard**: Next to "Logout" button

### Method 3: Keyboard Shortcut ⌨️
Press `Ctrl + D` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + D` (Mac) from anywhere in the app.
